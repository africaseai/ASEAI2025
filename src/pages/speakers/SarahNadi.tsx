                      Sarah Nadi is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Program at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). Before joining NYUAD, she spent almost eight years at the University of Alberta in Canada where she held a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Software reuse and lead the Software Maintenance and Reuse (SMR) lab. Sarah obtained her Master's (2010) and PhD (2014) degrees from the University of Waterloo in Canada and spent approximately two years as a post-doctoral researcher at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt in Germany.

                      At NYUAD, Sarah co-directs the SANAD lab whose goal is to enhance how software engineers develop and maintain software systems by providing them with the tools and insights that they need. Sarah's research expertise lies in empirical software engineering and software analytics. She has worked on a wide range of software engineering problems including finding bugs and inconsistencies in software product line, detecting insecure API usage, and leveraging LLMs for various development and maintenance tasks. Her recent work focuses on supporting developers as they use software libraries, including the initial selection process, correctly using the library's API, and potential migration to newer versions or alternative libraries.
