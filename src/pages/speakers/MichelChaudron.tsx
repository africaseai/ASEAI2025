                      Michel R. V. Chaudron is a Full Professor of the Software Engineering group within the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology (The Netherlands).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With over two decades of academic experience, Professor Chaudron has previously held positions at the University of Gothenburg/Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), Leiden University and in industry at CMG (now CGI).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      His research interests encompass software architecture, software design, software modelling, and empirical studies in industrial software engineering practice. Recently, he has focused on the architecting of digital twins (of the human body) and on integrating AI in software development processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      He also works towards increasing inclusiveness of academics from the 'Global South' in the software engineering community. He was co-PI for a 5-year capacity building project on Software and Informatics in Uganda (called 'BRIGHT'). He has organized several workshops co-located with earlier editions of ICSE on this topic, as well as co-organized an African Conference on Software Engineering.
